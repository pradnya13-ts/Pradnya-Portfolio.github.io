🧠 About Me

Hi there! I’m Pradnya, a passionate AI Developer and Researcher driven by curiosity and a deep desire to build intelligent systems that connect technology with human understanding.

From building my own version of JARVIS (a voice-controlled AI with IoT and computer vision) to designing Vita-AI (a medical diagnosis assistant), I’ve always believed that the best learning happens when you create something new.

Currently, I’m pursuing my Master’s in AI and ML in Science at Queen Mary University of London, where I’m exploring how data-driven intelligence can solve real-world problems across health, automation, and science.

🧩 Featured Projects
🧠 JARVIS – AI Voice Assistant with Home Automation & Object Detection

An intelligent AI voice assistant inspired by Iron Man’s J.A.R.V.I.S — integrating Flask, YOLOv8, NLP, IoT, and voice control.
🎙 Voice commands | 🏠 IoT device control | 📷 Object detection | 🧩 Multi-personality modes

💊 Vita AI – Disease Prediction System

A Flask-based AI health assistant that predicts diseases using symptom-based ML models and provides medical precautions.
🧬 Machine Learning (KNN) | 🩺 NLP symptom matching | 📊 Dynamic dashboard

📈 Stock Price Prediction System using LSTM

A Deep Learning project that forecasts stock prices using LSTM neural networks and visualizes trends with moving averages.
📊 Matplotlib charts | 💹 TensorFlow LSTM | 💻 Flask web app

🧍‍♀️ Real-Time Object Detection System

Implemented using YOLOv8 and OpenCV, enabling camera-based object detection for automation and security applications.
